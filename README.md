# Basic Network Sniffer – CodeAlpha Internship

## Project Description
This project is a basic network sniffer developed using Python and the Scapy library.
It captures live network traffic and displays important packet information such as
source IP address, destination IP address, and protocol type.

The project helps in understanding how data flows through a network
and how different protocols operate at the packet level.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scapy

## Features
- Captures live network packets
- Filters TCP traffic for better readability
- Displays source and destination IP addresses
- Uses packet limiting to avoid excessive output

## How It Works
The program listens to network traffic in real time using the Scapy library.
Since modern systems generate continuous traffic, a manual packet counter
is implemented to capture a limited number of packets for clear analysis.

## Ethical Disclaimer
This project is created strictly for educational and learning purposes.
Unauthorized monitoring or interception of network traffic is illegal.
